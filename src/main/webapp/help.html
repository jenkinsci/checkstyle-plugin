    Hudson understands <a href="http://pmd.sourceforge.net/">PMD</a> analysis report XML format.
    When this option is configured, Hudson can provide useful information about analysis results,
    such as historical result trend, web UI for viewing analysis reports, and so on.
    To use this feature, first set up your build to run PMD, then specify the path to PMD
    XML files in the Ant glob syntax, such as **/target/pmd.xml.
