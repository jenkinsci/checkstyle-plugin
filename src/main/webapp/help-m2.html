<p>Jenkins understands <a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle</a>
analysis report XML format. When this option is configured and your
build runs the maven goal <code>checkstyle:checkstyle</code> then Jenkins
provides useful information about analysis results, such as historical
result trend, module and package statistics, web UI for viewing analysis
reports and warnings, and so on.</p>
<p>This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called for
stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
